		<p class="long">Sadly, the LAN isn't free. This is because renting out a venue and
		buying networking gear isn't cheap. All of this is funded by myself (Smile) and I don't want to
		make any profit out of this event. My goal here is to bring people together and have fun!</p>
		
		<p class="long">The expected price is <em>&euro;41</em> per person. This is a one time fee which gives you access to everything
		on the event like: a sleeping place, power, internet, a cool venue, etc.</p>
		
		<p class="long"><em>Please note that this does not cover food and drinks!</em>
			There is a Delhaize less than 100m from the venue which is open during Sundays. Alternatively if you
		don't like healthier options, you can get lots of takeout and fast food from the city center, which is around a 10-minute walk from the venue.</p>
		
		<p class="long">Me (Smile) and the crew are working on a mini-bar which will offer drinks at an affordable price too!</p>
		
		<p class="long">Oh and, ticket purchase is available <em><a href="https://shop.rhythmlan.eu" target="_blank">here!</a></em></p>
